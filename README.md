# Getting Started with Rust and Cargo

Welcome to Rust! This README will guide you through the basic steps to start programming with Rust, using Cargo as your build tool and package manager.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Rust**: The Rust programming language.
  - You can install Rust by running the following command:
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

- **Cargo**: Cargo comes bundled with Rust. If you installed Rust using the method above, you already have Cargo!

To verify that both are installed, run:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version

cargo run
```
